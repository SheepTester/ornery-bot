you know what really grinds my gears? when people say `ok moofy`, `kk moofy`, `moofy ponder`, or `:whois`

`moofy go fetch [url]` fetches csv data with all your personal info from given url. if no given url will use previously given one (only cool people can do this)
`bruh who is <id>` exposes given user with their personal info

`moofy check out <name> at <url>` given webtoon episode list page i will set up a nice command for you to check it
`:<name>` gets latest webtoon episode
`moofy do not read <name>` stop checking
